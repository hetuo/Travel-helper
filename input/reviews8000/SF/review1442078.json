The Monument hotel is part of the Medieval city as opposed to being a tourist attraction.

The hotel itself was clean and spacious, including free internet in the office area. The staff were very helpful and always friendly.\nWe were able to put a travel cot in a seperated section (via a heavey curtain) of the room, thus allowing us to stay up after the little one had gone to bed.\nThe main reason for choosing this hotel was for the indoor pool. After reading a few reviews I was uncertain as to what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised to find a clean and well sized pool with good changing facilities. We had no problems in getting towels or using the lockers. The pool provided a refreshing alternative on a very hot day and a useful filler as much of the town seems closed during the early afternoon. The water was a good temperature and the little one loved it!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"Great location with a pool.","negativeRemarks":"A little expensive.","locationRemarks":"Great location, only a few minutes from tourist central.","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Ilkeston","reviewSubmissionTime":"2012-08-13T17:31:21Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"Stuart","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Families","categoryLabel":"Families"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"3","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_gb","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"1442078","reviewId":"36431278","photos":[],"itinId":"13136689763","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"2057","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Delightful accommodation.","reviewText":"We were delighted overall with our hotel and made our stay in Santiago de Compostela most comfortable.We were most impressed with the location, quality of furnishings and decor, peacefulness and enjoyed the pool area.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"A small point, there was no wifi signal in bedroom for iPad","locationRemarks":"Excellent, close to the cathedral yet set in own grounds.","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Inverness, Highland, UK","reviewSubmissionTime":"2012-07-02T09:29:15Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"1442078","reviewId":"34447695","photos":[],"itinId":"145498556863","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Roberto","brandType":"Expedia","title":"WiFi and Pool","reviewText":"WiFi does not work at rooms...staff thinks that's normal....
