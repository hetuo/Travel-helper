It is literally a doorway, with reception on the 6th floor.  We had 2 family rooms, each with 2 double beds, on the 5th and 6th floors.  The layout of the hotel meant that the family room on the 5th floor basically had its own private bathroom which was a bonus.  The rooms were spotless and the common area offered an amazing view of old San Juan and the waterfront. We were treated to beautiful music being played in the square in front of the hotel. We had 2 nights sitting out on the balcony using the hotels wifi and being serenaded by the most talented singers and musicians.  It was magical. \r\n The elevator to get to the hotel was \"interesting\".  It worked most of the time but was definitely temperamental. After being stuck in it twice my gorgeous13 year old used the stairs.  Make sure you don't overload it and you should be fine.\r\nThere are heaps of spectacular restaurants nearby that serve traditional Puerto Rican food but they are a bit pricey so be prepared.  \r\nOverall we had a lovely 2 days exploring this exquisite city and soaking in the culture.. \r\n...got to love San Juan. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"location location location","negativeRemarks":"\r\nceiling fans in the rooms would help with the heat...It was very hot and hard to sleep at night","locationRemarks":"\r\nThe Fort is next door and there are plenty of places to eat in the old city.

After several tries to call, eventually got through to someone who assured me that they had staff at the desk 24 hours to let us in, and she also assured me that she would note our arrival time to make sure we got in... but once we arrived, they did not answer the doorbell or phone so it looked like we would be locked out.  Luckily, our taxi driver did a google search on his mobile and found another phone number, not listed on their web page, and we were let in after waiting about 20 minutes.  Once we were inside, the lady at the desk was very friendly and helpful.  The rooms were very basic, but clean, the location is great, and there are good views from the balconies.

Now its a pretty minimalist place but if you're looking for that its perfect. Our private room was very clean, bed was comfortable enough and the shared bathroom was clean and never seemed to be occupied. The common area was very nice with a patio looking over the square. Its in a great location and we could walk all around Old San Juan. Again if you're looking for luxury this is not your place but if you're up for sometime simple its worth saving the money.
