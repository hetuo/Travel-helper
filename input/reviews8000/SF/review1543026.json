Secondly, everything is hand written, we got a booked a 2bedroom and he \"gave it\" to someone else, told us he would accommodate us in the morning- so we kept following up with him and the guy during the night shift and they're both aggogant people who just brushed off the questions. Never have straight answers and contradicted each other. Third, we ordered room service and it was simple, pancakes... Dear Lord! 2.5hrs later and nothing. We called to follow up since we were about to head downtown and the cooks said \"it's on it's way, we already cooked it\".. 5min later they call us back only to tell us they ran out of food and can't complete our order! 2.5hrs later... The hotel personal just kind of hangs out in the lobby and sits there looking bored and staring at you as you pass by, kind of oddly of them to not find anything to do buy sit and stare. But I mean, you get what you pay for at this hotel... And did I meantion roaches?.. Yep. Also, rock hard pillows... Wifi doesn't work, extremely noisy by 7am.. So enjoy your stay, as for me?

I am not sure if the overhaul is still in progress. The rooms are freshly painted. My main concerns are two: the new beds are extremely hard and uncomfortable; and the bathroom was untouched and much in need of attention. There are mold stains on the bathroom ceiling, and we had to remove the clogged shower head to be able to bathe with a stream of water. The shower door has been removed, meaning the entire bathroom gets wet. We were expecting to stay again in a few days and changed our reservation to another hotel, mainly due to the poor night's sleep. This could be a gem of a reasonably priced hotel if it were not for the beds and the bathrooms. Apart from the rock-hard mattresses, the pillows and linens are of very poor quality, with not even a mattress cover under the sheets. If these can be improved, I will be happy to return.

We visited a number of hotels in person, on our first pass through Guadalajara. We had already chosen this one for its great location - close to the excitement of the city centre, but on a quiet street with its own small plaza. It has a beautiful peaceful courtyard lobby, efficient staff, and a restaurant offering food and service that rivals the best Mexican family restaurants in town (with a sunny courtyard for cheerful breakfasting). We'd already made decided to stay when we discovered a bonus - the discount available when booking through Expedia! There are a range of rooms available, some of them are in the old section, with beautifully appointed rooms. Ours was in the new section, spacious clean & well furnished. A small but important convenience: the hotel is just a few blocks from the major bus routes, and is right beside a taxi stand - which made our early morning airport departure a breeze!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Nanaimo, BC","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-03-31T17:31:55Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"1543026","reviewId":"20617450","photos":[],"itinId":"311654187","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"April","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great value and location!","reviewText":"If you are a looking for a modern hotel with contemporary styling, this hotel or others in the historic downtown/centro area are not for you.\n\nBut I preferred the historic charm of this hotel with its courtyards and foutains as well as indoor/outdoor feel.
