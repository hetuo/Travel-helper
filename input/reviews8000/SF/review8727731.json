Great value.","reviewText":"This is a nice hotel. Room is large enough, has a frig., reasonably priced mini bar and is remarkably clean. I had a delux single - one queen (the least expensive) room. I have only two issues - the room they gave me - interior first floor had no window. So...no morning light, no idea what the weather was. The receptionist (very nice woman) advised that next time, I specify that I want a window. My other issue can be fixed at no expense. Although the room was clean, the bed was VERY poorly made - bedspread pulled up over sheets that have just been thrown on the bed and not tucked - top or bottom sheet. The top sheet was on sideways and barely came to my shoulder, so before I could sleep, I had to remake the whole bed. Costs nothing to do a good job of preparing the bed so I hope they take care of that before I return. Having said that, everything else was great - wifi worked, complimentary toiletries in the bath, hot water if you wait for it, new mattress and good central location. I will choose San Francisco de Asis again. If the bed issue has been addressed, I'll let you know.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"W","userLocation":"Sosua, DR","reviewSubmissionTime":"2014-09-28T18:58:44Z","roomTypeId":200743956,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]}]}}}
